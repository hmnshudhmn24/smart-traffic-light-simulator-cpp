# Smart Traffic Light Simulator

## Overview
This project simulates an AI-powered traffic light system that dynamically adjusts signal timing based on real-time traffic density.

## Features
- Uses a rule-based system to adjust traffic light duration.
- Simulates traffic density and adapts signals accordingly.
- Periodically updates and displays traffic conditions.

## Files
- `main.cpp` - The main C++ program implementing the traffic light logic.
- `README.md` - This documentation file.

## How to Run
1. Compile the program using `g++ main.cpp -o traffic_sim`.
2. Run the executable using `./traffic_sim`.

## Requirements
- A C++ compiler (GCC recommended)
- A terminal supporting `clear` command for real-time updates.
